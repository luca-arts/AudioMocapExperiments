# TOPIC

## Context

*What's the context in which we want to research something?*

## overview of libraries

*List libraries which you want to test or experiment with*

## testing a library

we'll first evaluate a library before appending it to the [topic.ipynb](./topic.ipynb) file.

This way we want to keep a clean overview of already tested notebooks. If a notebook is still in [playground](./playground/) then it's not working yet or we think we can iterate/improve on it.

First go to create a new [colab](https://colab.research.google.com) notebook. Then save the notebook in the git repository (with the option to generate a badge).
